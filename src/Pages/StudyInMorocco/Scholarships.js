					<h4>Scholarship in Morocco </h4>

					<div>
						<p>Morocco welcomes thousands of foreign students on a yearly basis. It's no secret that the north African kingdom has become a study destination for many students , especially in sub saharan Africa.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>The Moroccan Agency of International Cooperation(AMCI) offers training grants to foreign students under the conditions and according to the procedures set out in the scholarship regulations, a copy of which is made available to the students concerned.</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>&nbsp;A.M.C.I. &nbsp;are awarded annually:</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>&nbsp;within the framework of cooperation agreements between the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco and the Governments of receiving countries;</p>
						<p>&nbsp;as part of the Moroccan scholarship offer notified to beneficiary countries.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>&nbsp;The training grant is awarded to the student holding, at least, the baccalaureate or a recognized equivalent diploma, to pursue higher education or professional training cycle, in a Moroccan public establishment, sanctioned by a diploma of &nbsp;State.</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>&nbsp;The scholarship offers relate exclusively to the current year. &nbsp;Unused scholarship quotas, as well as unused scholarships for the same year, may not be carried over or accumulated for subsequent budget years.</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>&nbsp;The training grant is a supplementary grant. &nbsp;Its granting does not in any way imply the payment of registration, boarding, transport, or any other charges inherent in the pursuit of studies, and which remain the responsibility of the student.</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>&nbsp;The amount of the training grant is seven hundred and fifty Dirhams (750.00) per month, or as an indication 89 US dollars, whatever the cycle, the nature of the training, and its duration.</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>&nbsp;The training grant is granted for the regulatory duration of the cycle followed.</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>&nbsp;Payment of the scholarship is linked to the effective and regular presence of the beneficiary in the establishment with which he is registered.</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>&nbsp;The training grant is payable bi-monthly, by the schedule set by AMCI.</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>&nbsp;Payment of the scholarship is made at the counters of the Agencies of the Banque Centrale Populaire network throughout the Kingdom on the presentation of the beneficiary's passport. &nbsp;To this end, the AMCI scholarship student is required to check the validity of his passport, to proceed in the event of its renewal expiring within the required time limits, and to immediately file a copy with AMCI.</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>&nbsp;The scholarship is renewed, as the case may be, either at the beginning of each academic year or at the beginning of the academic semester for students registered in the semester system. &nbsp;The following documents are made, after filing with the AMCI services:</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>&nbsp;Form for regularization of the registration situation for the current year, duly completed, to be obtained from the AMCI services or to be downloaded from its website;</p>
						<p>&nbsp;certified true copies:</p>
						<p>&nbsp;• the registration certificate for the current year/semester;</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>&nbsp;• the certificate of results or transcripts for the previous year/semester.</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>&nbsp;• the passport, in the event of its renewal or extension (pages ) appear the surname and first name of the holder, the passport number, its validity date, the identity photo).</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>&nbsp;A scholarship certificate is given to the student entitled to the AMCI scholarship for the current academic year.</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>&nbsp;Any change, of course, cycle, institution, or city without the prior agreement of the AMCI results in the final termination of the scholarship.</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>&nbsp;Scholarship students enrolled in the Masters or equivalent cycle and the doctoral cycle can benefit from a flat-rate aid relating to the printing costs of their final dissertations/theses, subject to submission to AMCI of a &nbsp;copy of the book, a certified true copy of the diploma or certificate of successful completion or completion of training.</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>&nbsp;For more information on scholarships awarded by AMCI, please see contact the Ministry of Education, Republic of Liberia.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>On the other hand, scholarships in Morocco are also offered by Private institutions or institutions partially funded by the government. Students who have been awarded a scholarship at any private institute should immediately contact the office of the Education Liaison officer to register their stay in Morocco.</p>
